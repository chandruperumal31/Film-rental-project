Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze a rental database using SQL queries to extract valuable insights and answer specific questions related to revenue generation, rental trends, film properties, customer behavior, and database constraints. By addressing each question comprehensively, this project aims to provide actionable information to stakeholders for decision-making and optimization of rental operations.

Approach:

Understanding Data Schema: Begin by comprehensively understanding the structure of the rental database, including tables, relationships, and attributes.

Query Formulation: Develop SQL queries tailored to address each question effectively, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in data retrieval.

Data Analysis: Execute queries to extract relevant data and perform necessary calculations to derive insights related to revenue generation, rental patterns, film characteristics, customer behavior, and database constraints.

Result Interpretation: Analyze query results to derive meaningful conclusions and insights that address the objectives of each question.

Documentation: Document the SQL queries, analysis process, and key findings in a clear and concise manner to facilitate understanding and interpretation by stakeholders.

Optimization Suggestions: Provide recommendations for optimizing rental operations and improving decision-making based on the insights obtained from the data analysis.
